---

## üìñ Usage

### Basic Usage

Simply run the script and follow the interactive prompts:

```bash
python port_scanner.py
```

### Interactive Prompts

#### 1. Enter Target(s)

You'll be prompted to enter one or more targets:

```
[*] Enter Targets To Scan (split them by ,): 
```

**Options:**
- **Single Target**: `192.168.1.1`
- **Multiple Targets**: `192.168.1.1, 10.0.0.1, 8.8.8.8`
- **Hostnames**: `example.com, google.com`
- **Mixed**: `192.168.1.1, example.com, 10.0.0.5`

#### 2. Enter Port Range

Specify how many ports to scan (starting from port 1):

```
[*] Enter How Many Ports You Want To Scan: 
```

**Examples:**
- `100` - Scans ports 1-100
- `1000` - Scans ports 1-1000
- `65535` - Scans all possible ports

---

## üí° Examples

### Example 1: Single Target Scan

Scanning a single local server for common ports:

```bash
$ python port_scanner.py
[*] Enter Targets To Scan (split them by ,): 192.168.1.1
[*] Enter How Many Ports You Want To Scan: 1000

Scanning Target: 192.168.1.1
-----------------------------------------
[+] Port 22 is open   (SSH)
[+] Port 80 is open   (HTTP)
[+] Port 443 is open  (HTTPS)
[+] Port 3306 is open (MySQL)
-----------------------------------------
Scan Complete for 192.168.1.1
```

### Example 2: Multiple Target Scan

Scanning multiple servers simultaneously:

```bash
$ python port_scanner.py
[*] Enter Targets To Scan (split them by ,): 192.168.1.1, 192.168.1.5, 10.0.0.10
[*] Enter How Many Ports You Want To Scan: 500

Scanning Target: 192.168.1.1
-----------------------------------------
[+] Port 22 is open
[+] Port 80 is open
-----------------------------------------

Scanning Target: 192.168.1.5
-----------------------------------------
[+] Port 21 is open
[+] Port 22 is open
[+] Port 443 is open
-----------------------------------------

Scanning Target: 10.0.0.10
-----------------------------------------
[+] Port 3389 is open
-----------------------------------------
All Scans Complete!
```

### Example 3: Domain Name Scan

Scanning a website:

```bash
$ python port_scanner.py
[*] Enter Targets To Scan (split them by ,): google.com
[*] Enter How Many Ports You Want To Scan: 100

Scanning Target: google.com (142.250.185.46)
-----------------------------------------
[+] Port 80 is open
[+] Port 443 is open
-----------------------------------------
Scan Complete for google.com
```

## üîç How It Works

### Port Scanning Process

1. **Target Resolution** - Converts hostnames to IP addresses using DNS
2. **Socket Creation** - Creates TCP socket for each port
3. **Connection Attempt** - Tries to establish connection to target:port
4. **Status Check** - Determines if port is open or closed:
   - **Open Port**: Connection successful (returns 0)
   - **Closed Port**: Connection refused or timeout
5. **Result Display** - Shows open ports in real-time

### TCP Connection Method

The scanner uses TCP SYN scanning approach:

```
Client ‚Üí [SYN] ‚Üí Server (Port)
   ‚Üì
Server ‚Üí [SYN-ACK] ‚Üí Client (Port Open)
   ‚Üì
Client ‚Üí [RST] ‚Üí Server (Connection Closed)
```

If the server responds with SYN-ACK, the port is open. Otherwise, it's closed or filtered.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

### Socket Programming

The scanner leverages Python's `socket` library:

```python
import socket

# Create TCP socket
sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

# Set timeout to avoid hanging
sock.settimeout(1)

# Attempt connection
result = sock.connect_ex((target_ip, port))

# Check result
if result == 0:
    print(f"Port {port} is open")
```

### Connection States

- **connect_ex() = 0** ‚Üí Port is open and accepting connections
- **connect_ex() ‚â† 0** ‚Üí Port is closed, filtered, or unreachable

### Performance Considerations

- **Timeout Settings**: Default 1 second per port
- **Sequential Scanning**: Scans ports one at a time
- **Network Latency**: Affects scan speed
- **Target Distance**: Remote hosts take longer

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Customizing the Scanner

You can modify the script to adjust:

1. **Timeout Duration**
```python
sock.settimeout(2)  # Increase to 2 seconds for slower networks
```

2. **Port Range**
```python
# Modify to scan specific ranges
for port in range(1, 1024):  # Scan well-known ports only
```

3. **Output Format**
```python
# Add more details to output
print(f"[+] Port {port} is OPEN - {get_service_name(port)}")
```

---

## üìà Performance Tips

### Optimize Scan Speed

1. **Reduce Port Range**: Scan only necessary ports
2. **Adjust Timeout**: Lower timeout for faster networks
3. **Target Local Networks**: Scans complete faster on LANs
4. **Close Unnecessary Applications**: Free up system resources

### Common Port Ranges

- **Well-Known Ports**: 1-1023
- **Registered Ports**: 1024-49151
- **Dynamic Ports**: 49152-65535

- ‚úÖ **Compliance** - Follow local and international laws
- ‚úÖ **Professional Use** - Use in authorized security assessments
- ‚úÖ **Educational Context** - Use in controlled learning environments

### ‚ùå Illegal Activities

- ‚ùå **Unauthorized Scanning** - Scanning without permission is illegal
- ‚ùå **Network Intrusion** - Attempting to access secured systems
- ‚ùå **Malicious Intent** - Using for attacks or exploitation
- ‚ùå **Privacy Violation** - Scanning networks without authorization

### üìú Legal Disclaimer

**The author and contributors are NOT responsible for:**
- Misuse of this tool
- Unauthorized network scanning
- Illegal activities performed with this software
- Any damages caused by improper use

**Users assume ALL responsibility and liability for their actions.**

---

## üîí Security & Privacy

### Scan Detection

Port scanning can be detected by:
- Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)
- Firewall logs
- Network monitoring tools
- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems

### Best Practices

1. **Authorization First** - Always obtain permission
2. **Rate Limiting** - Don't overwhelm target systems
3. **Logging** - Keep records of authorized scans
4. **Responsible Disclosure** - Report vulnerabilities properly
5. **Legal Compliance** - Follow applicable laws and regulations

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Connection Timeouts
**Problem**: Scans taking too long
**Solution**: Increase timeout value or scan fewer ports

#### Permission Denied
**Problem**: Cannot bind to low ports (<1024)
**Solution**: Run with appropriate permissions (sudo on Linux/Mac)

#### Network Unreachable
**Problem**: Cannot connect to target
**Solution**: Verify network connectivity and target IP

#### Hostname Resolution Failed
**Problem**: Cannot resolve domain names
**Solution**: Check DNS settings or use IP addresses directly
